Bestochy.tech Outage Report: Meow-y Mishap with a Happy Ending!

# Issue Summary:
Hey FemFam! We encountered a purr-oblem this past Saturday, February 17th, from 2:00 PM to 11:00 PM GMT+1. While most of our admins were catching some much-needed zzz's, a mischievous feline decided to play electrician, resulting in some temporary downtime. No need to worry, though! Our valiant technicians sprang into action to restore service and ensure your Bestochy experience remained top-notch.

# Impact:
While the outage wasn't purrfect, it primarily affected our website and services for about 9 hours. We understand this might have caused some inconvenience, and we sincerely apologize for any disruption to your beauty product browsing or femboy community fun.

# Timeline:
2:00 PM GMT+1: A curious kitty (we suspect it might have been the infamous Server Snuggles) unplugged our database server, taking our website and services offline.
4:00 PM GMT+1: Our monitoring system bravely alerted us to the issue, but due to our small team and everyone catching up on sleep, it took a little longer than usual to notice.
4:30 PM GMT+1: We quickly dispatched our most pawsome technician to the admin's house (with treats in tow, of course!) to investigate.
5:00 PM GMT+1: The culprit's identity was revealed, and the power cable was promptly reconnected. Phew!
7:00 PM GMT+1: Our website and services were back online, purring like new.
8:00 PM GMT+1: As a token of our apology and to show our appreciation for your understanding, we decided to shower our affected customers with free Blahaj plushies! (Limited quantities available, meow!)

# Root Cause and Resolution:
The outage was caused by an unplugged power cable, thanks to a playful kitty with electrician ambitions. To prevent future feline-related incidents, we've implemented stricter server room security measures (including laser pointers as deterrents) and emphasized the importance of double-checking connections. We're also considering investing in chew toys specifically designed for server-loving cats.

# Corrective and Preventative Measures:
Enhanced server room security: We've installed cat-proof locks and implemented a buddy system to ensure regular server checks, even during nap times.
Improved monitoring: We're upgrading our monitoring system to send more pursistent alerts and integrate them with our team communication channels.
Redundancy meow-asures: We're setting up a secondary database server and ensuring proper configuration to avoid future single points of failure.
Feline enrichment program: We'll be providing the server room with cat-friendly toys and scratching posts to redirect any mischievous energy.
We truly appreciate your understanding and purr-sistence during this unexpected outage. We're committed to providing you with the best possible Bestochy experience, and we'll continue to work hard to prevent future meow-haps. Stay pawsome, FemFam!
